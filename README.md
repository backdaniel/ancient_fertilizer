# Basalt + Fertilizer
Adds basalt to Minetest Game which can be made into fertilizer.

- Basalt, one of the most common rocks on Earth.
- Crushed basalt instead of the traditional bone meal.
- Created for [minetest_game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), with gameplay balance in mind.

In this mod, basalt, a rock abundant in key nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, is crushed and used to enrich the soil, leading to crops, flowers, cactus, papyrus, saplings and grass growth.

Textures from [too_many_stones](https://content.minetest.net/packages/JoeEnderman/too_many_stones/) (modified).
