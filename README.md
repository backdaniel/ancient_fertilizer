# Basalt + Fertilizer
In this mod, basalt, one of the most common rocks on Earth, abundant in key nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, is crushed and used to enrich the soil, leading to flowers, saplings and grass duplication.

Created for [minetest_game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), with gameplay balance in mind. Textures from [too_many_stones](https://content.minetest.net/packages/JoeEnderman/too_many_stones/) (modified).

## Features
- Basalt starts at y = 0 (sea level) and down.
- Supports flora duplication (including flowers).

- Won't spawn patches of flora on soil.
- Won't "grow" saplings or crops.
