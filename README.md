# Basalt + Fertilizer
In this mod, basalt, one of the most common rocks on Earth, abundant in key nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, is crushed and used to enrich the soil, leading to flowers and grass duplication.

Created for [minetest_game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), with gameplay balance in mind. Textures from [too_many_stones](https://content.minetest.net/packages/JoeEnderman/too_many_stones/) (modified).

## Features
- Basalt starts at y = -255 (underground) and below.
- Supports flora duplication (including flowers).
- Kelp and Coral (rooted) are now renewable.
- Waterlily is now renewable.
- Wild Cotton can now be placed in survival, and is renewable.

## Distinctions
- Duplicates vegetation.
- Won't spawn patches of flora on soil.
- Won't "grow" saplings or crops.
- Simple and extensible.

Q: What not to duplicate?
A: Anything that doesn't naturally spawn in the world.

Q: Why does basalt have a cobbled variation?
A: Design consistency, sedimentary rocks (like sandstone) drop themselves, and igneous rocks (like stone) drop cobble.

Q: Why can't the bricks make walls?
A: Design consistency, only cobble variants make walls.
