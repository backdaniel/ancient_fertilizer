# Basalt + Fertilizer
In this mod, basalt, one of the most common rocks on Earth, abundant in key nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, is crushed and used to enrich the soil, leading to flowers and grass duplication. Useful for farming flowers if you need dye for colored nodes.

Created for [minetest_game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), with gameplay balance in mind. Textures from [too_many_stones](https://content.minetest.net/packages/JoeEnderman/too_many_stones/) (modified).

## Features
- Basalt starts at y = -255 (underground) and below.
- Supports flora duplication (including flowers).
- Kelp and Coral (rooted) are now renewable.
- Waterlily is now renewable.
- Wild Cotton can now be placed in survival, and is renewable.

## Distinctions
- Duplicates vegetation.
- Won't spawn patches of flora on soil.
- Won't "grow" saplings or crops.
- Simple and extensible.

## Design Choices
- Anything that doesn't generate in the world can't be duplicated.
