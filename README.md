# Ancient Fertilizer
In this mod, Ancient Stone, abundant in key nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, is crushed and used to enrich the soil, leading to flowers, grass, mushroom and sapling duplication.

Created for [minetest_game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), with gameplay balance in mind. Working on support for MineClone2.

## Features
- Ancient Stone starts at y = -255 (underground) and below.
- Good for farming flowers for dye.
- New Ancient Stone texture and cracked variations.
- Simple and extensible.

## Distinctions
- Duplicates vegetation.
- Won't spawn patches of flora on soil.
- Won't "grow" saplings or crops.

## Design Choices
- Try to support plants from other mods without tweaks.
- Should only duplicate renewable resources.
